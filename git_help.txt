>git branch <new-branch-name>
CHECKING STATUS:
>git status <<< Will tell you which branch you are on and if you have any staged changes ready for commit
COMMIT YOUR CHANGES:
First make some changes you want to make to some file!
>git add --all <<< Adds all changes you made to any file to the 'stage'
>git commit -m 'message goes here' <<< make a commit with a message (A message is required)

Once you have changes commited
